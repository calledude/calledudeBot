# calledudeBot

A personal bot I wrote because there weren't any other options out there that let you interact with viewers easily if you only have one monitor. This bot will help mitigate the ever so frustating problem of having to alt-tab constantly.

Various API keys and whatnot are needed to make this work.

## Functionality:
* twitch -> osu! relaying of messages
* osu! -> twitch relay
* Announcing when stream goes live on discord
* Various commands 
  * !np/!song/!playing
  * !uptime
  * !help/!cmds/!commands
* Ability to add/delete custom commands with !addcmd and !delcmd
* Requesting osu! beatmaps in twitch chat (relayed to osu!)
* osu! rank updates displayed in twitch chat
* Automation of initial setup
* Verification of credentials

## Planned:
* Disconnection watcher
* Spam protection
* Wiki - To explain how to use the bot and how to set it up.
* Encryption of API keys
* Hopefully get Spotify integration going again

#### Disclaimer:

Now, I realize next to no-one will ever read this, but I want it to be said either way.

I created it firstly because I only have one monitor and tabbing out to read chat and whatnot became a hassle. With that in mind, I had some prior programming experience and wanted to see if I could do it, as a learning experience of sorts.
At first it was a very simple program and I felt like I knew what I was doing. This changed when I wanted to start experimenting, test my limits and knowledge. 
At this point I'm basically just throwing things around, so if you're trying to understand the codebase, expect to get angry since I'm re-structuring pretty much all the time. It's because I'm not the best programmer that exist in this world, I simply don't have all the knowledge and this is my way to improve.
Why did you even read this?
