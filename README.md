# calledudeBot

A personal bot I wrote because there weren't any other options out there.

Various API keys and whatnot are needed to make this work.

#### This bot has functionality such as:
* twitch -> osu! relaying of messages
* osu! -> twitch relay
* Announcing when stream goes live on discord
* Various commands such as !np and !uptime
* Ability to add custom commands

#### Planned functionality:
* osu! rank updates - **IN PROGRESS**
* Spam protection
* Automation of initial setup - **Sort of fixed, small improvements might be done later**
  * Wiki?
* Encryption of API keys
