# calledudeBot

A personal bot I wrote because there weren't any other options out there.

Various API keys and whatnot are needed to make this work.
Now, I realize next to no-one will ever read this, but I want it to be said either way.
I created it firstly because I only have one monitor and tabbing out to read chat and whatnot became a hassle. With that in mind, I had some prior programming experience and wanted to see if I could do it, as a learning experience of sorts.
At first it was a very simple program and I felt like I knew what I was doing. This changed when I wanted to start experimenting, test my limits and knowledge. At this point I'm basically just throwing things around, so if you're trying to understand the codebase, expect to get angry since I'm re-structuring pretty much all the time. It's because I'm not the best programmer that exist in this world, I simply don't have all the knowledge and this is my way to improve.
Why did you even read this?
