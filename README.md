# calledudeBot

A personal bot I wrote because there weren't any other options out there.

THIS IS _**NOT**_ WRITTEN TO BE FOR GENERAL USE.

A lot of the code is hardcoded to fit my own needs, such as which channel to write the stream updates to.
To be able to use this yourself it requires knowledge of how to write code (or atleast the know-how to change existing code).
Various API keys are also needed to make this work.

#### This bot has functionality such as:
* twitch -> osu! relaying of messages
* osu! -> twitch relay
* Announcing when stream goes live on discord
* Various commands such as !np and !uptime
* Ability to add custom commands

#### Planned functionality:
* osu! rank updates
* Spam protection
* Automation of initial setup
